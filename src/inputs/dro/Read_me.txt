The front-end will need to search for a suitable DRO and if found copy it into a folder that the back-end can access, e.g. src/inputs/dro (i.e. this directory).

For the time being the folder will remain empty so image registration will be performed without the option of by-passing it with a suitable DRO (as in the stand-alone version in app.py).
